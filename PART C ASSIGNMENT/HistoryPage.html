                            <h3>Australia in WW2</h3>
                            <p>Australia entered World War II on 3 September 1939, following the government's acceptance
                                of
                                the
                                United
                                Kingdom's declaration of war on Nazi Germany.
                                Australia later entered into a state of war with other members of the Axis powers,
                                including
                                the
                                Kingdom
                                of Italy on 11 June 1940, and the Empire of Japan on 9 December 1941.
                                By the end of the war, almost a million Australians had served in the armed forces,
                                whose
                                military
                                units
                                fought primarily in the European theatre, North African campaign, and the South West
                                Pacific
                                theatre. In
                                addition, Australia came under direct attack for the first time in its post-colonial
                                history.
                                Its casualties from enemy action during the war were 27,073 killed and 23,477 wounded.

                                World War II contributed to major changes in the nation's economy, military and foreign
                                policy.
                                The war accelerated the process of industrialisation, led to the development of a larger
                                peacetime
                                military and began the process with which Australia shifted the focus of its foreign
                                policy
                                from
                                Britain
                                to the United States.
                                The final effects of the war also contributed to the development of a more diverse and
                                cosmopolitan
                                Australian society.</p>

                            <p>Australian Army units were gradually withdrawn from the Mediterranean and Europe
                                following
                                the
                                outbreak
                                of war with Japan.
                                However, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy units and personnel
                                continued
                                to
                                take
                                part
                                in the war against Germany and Italy. From 1942 until early 1944, Australian forces
                                played a
                                key
                                role in
                                the Pacific War, making up the majority of Allied strength throughout much of the
                                fighting
                                in
                                the
                                South
                                West Pacific theatre.
                                While the military was largely relegated to subsidiary fronts from mid-1944, it
                                continued
                                offensive
                                operations against the Japanese until the war ended.</p>
